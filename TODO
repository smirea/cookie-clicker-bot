### Managed with VSCode Todo+ extension

Todo:
    ☐ detect prestige and reset state or reload (e.g. upgrade fatigue stays disabled) @low
    ☐ REALLY figure out proper CPS, buildings aren't being bought on ascension @high
    ☐ building: include price in buy decision, 2 buildings with roughly the same cpsPriceRatio should buy the cheaper one @high
    ☐ offline tactics: leave wrinklers on in the evening, turn on golden switch at say 8pm
    ☐ reincarnate optimization - buying too many early buildings
    ☐ better pantheon logic: use the sell buildings guy
    ✔ Refactor BuyTimer to be modular @started(22-01-07 09:50) @done(22-01-07 17:07) @lasted(7h17m31s)
